## Frame 3 — Just ask

- scene: A Pistachio window floats on the wallpaper with an inbox open; ⌘I opens the agent panel, a plain-words request types in, and the agent does it — opening, replying, archiving — each step listed live. Ends on "Inside the tabs you're already signed in to."
- voiceover: ""
- copy: 1.5 keycaps "⌘ I" · 2.5–5.5 typed prompt "Reply to the top email saying I'll be ten minutes late, then archive it." · 6.0 step "01 Opened the top email" · 8.5 step "02 Typed the reply" · 11.0 step "03 Sent it and archived the thread" · 13.0 "It works inside the tabs" · 13.5 "you're already signed in to."

narrativeRole: prove the promise — plain words in, a real chore done, inside a signed-in tab, with every step visible.
keyMessage: ask in plain words; it does the work in your own tabs and shows each step.

The receipt borrows agent-progress-theater: rows arrive and check off while the machine visibly works.

UI build (HTML reconstruction, crisp at 1080p — match the real Pistachio shell in feature-agent.jpg and the site hero):
- Window ~1560×900, radius 16px, centered on the wallpaper, soft long shadow. Left sidebar ~300px of translucent green glass (`rgba(232,244,236,.55)`, backdrop blur): traffic lights (12px dots) + back/forward/reload glyphs; a URL field "mail.google.com" in a mono-ish small grey; a 3×2 grid of pinned tiles (the favicons on light tiles, radius 10px); "+ New tab"; "Live tabs" label; tab rows: "Inbox (3)" (active, white pill, with a small generic envelope glyph), "Pistachio – Wikipedia" (wikipedia favicon), "GitHub" (github favicon).
- Main pane (white, radius 12px, inset ~8px): a clean generic mail app (no Gmail branding — a neutral "Inbox" header, search field, rows). Rows (sender bold · subject · snippet grey · time right): 1) "Maya Chen — Standup moved to 9:30 · Can everyone still make it? …  8:52 AM" (unread dot green), 2) "Linear — 3 issues assigned to you · 8:10 AM", 3) "Jonah Park — Q4 roadmap draft · Left comments on section 2 … Yesterday", 4) "Figma — Maya invited you to 'Launch deck' · Yesterday", 5) "Stripe — Your weekly summary · Mon".
- Agent panel (right, ~430px, white/paper, opens inside the window pushing the pane narrower): header shell-glyph avatar + "Pistachio" + small "Ready" / "Working…" status; empty state "What can I do in your browser?" (display 400, ~34px); composer at bottom (rounded 14px, 1px border) placeholder "Ask Pistachio to do anything in your browser…".
- After send: the user message sits as a right-aligned bubble (paper tint); below it a "Steps" card styled like the site's OG card: label "Steps so far" left, "3 actions" right (counter ticks 1→2→3), rows with a small square badge "01/02/03" (green tile, white mono-ish numerals) + text; each row lands with a green check that draws on.
- The agent's focus: a soft green outline highlight (2px `#52A862`, radius 8px, faint green fill 8%) that glides onto whatever element the agent is acting on — the "agent cursor". No mouse pointer.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.5s): Wallpaper full-bleed (continuous from Frame 2). The window rises into place (y +60 → 0, scale 0.96 → 1, opacity 0 → 1, `power3.out`) showing the inbox; sidebar glass visible over the wallpaper.
Scene 2 (1.5–2.5s): Two floating macOS keycaps "⌘" and "I" (white, radius 14px, soft shadow, ~96px) pop in over the lower-center of the window and press down; on the press the agent panel slides in from the right edge of the window and the mail pane narrows in sync (`anchored-layout-expand`). Keycaps fade away as the panel lands. Status "Ready".
Scene 3 (2.5–5.5s): The camera eases in toward the panel (~1.25×, focus on the panel's lower half) while the prompt types into the composer with a caret: "Reply to the top email saying I'll be ten minutes late, then archive it." (`discrete-text-sequence` type-on with caret).
Scene 4 (5.5–6.0s): Send button presses; the prompt lifts into a user bubble at the top of the panel; status flips to "Working…" with a small green pulsing dot (finite). Camera eases back out to show the whole window (~1.0×).
Scene 5 (6.0–8.5s): Steps card appears under the bubble. Row "01 Opened the top email" lands (checks on). In the pane, the green agent highlight glides onto the top row (Maya Chen), then the pane swaps to the open email view: subject "Standup moved to 9:30", sender line, two lines of body text, and a reply box below.
Scene 6 (8.5–11.0s): Row "02 Typed the reply" lands. Highlight glides to the reply box; text types in: "Running about ten minutes late — start without me, I'll catch up." Counter "2 actions".
Scene 7 (11.0–13.0s): Row "03 Sent it and archived the thread" lands; highlight hits "Send" (tiny press), the view returns to the inbox, and the Maya Chen row collapses out (height → 0, others slide up); a small dark toast "Conversation archived" rises bottom-center of the pane. Status returns to "Ready" with a green check. Counter "3 actions".
Scene 8 (13.0–16.0s): The window glides right and scales to ~0.78, opening the left ~35% of the frame over the darker part of the wallpaper; there, left-aligned white display type (~72px, Inter 400) rises per-word: "It works inside the tabs" / "you're already signed in to." with "signed in" in field green `#E8F4EC`… (keep contrast: white on the dark wallpaper; add a very soft dark radial behind the text only if needed for contrast). Hold still from 14.5s to the end.
- handoff_in: wallpaper — full-bleed, centered, object-fit cover, scale 1.0, x 0, y 0, opacity 1, static (identical to Frame 2's end state).

## Selected blueprint: prompt-type-submit-generate

# prompt-type-submit-generate — Prompt, Submit, Generate

**intent**: The AI-era demo shot — a `[prompt / query / command]` types character-by-character into a REAL product input (chat composer, search bar, terminal prompt, URL bar, sidebar assistant) and the machine answers: status theater into a streaming answer / agent action log / diff cards / chart / generated artifact — or the clip cuts at the submit and the ask itself is the show. The keyboard is the actor and the product is the responder. Distinct from `typewriter-reveal` (a line typed as bare typography on an empty field — no product surface, nothing answers) and from `cursor-ui-demo` (a cursor clicking a reconstructed UI through states — there the pointer drives every change; here any cursor work only primes the input or lands the submit, and every state change after that is the machine's own doing).

**roles served**

- Hook (from `app-window-push-in-prompt-typing`): when the opener is "watch me ask" — typed headline beat(s), ONE eased push-in lands tight on the product's input, the prompt types and the clip ends at / just after submission (sub-shape A).
- Hook (from `typed-command-output-scroll`): when the demo loop ITSELF is the hook — command in, output builds and scrolls, and a second command / retype starts before the cut, ending mid-action (sub-shapes B/C with the restart ending).
- Product_Intro (from `prompt-typing-composer`): when the first look at the product IS its composer — a brand beat opens onto the input surface, a long prompt types with hovers / attachments / dropdown picks, and the camera steers gently toward the input or the confirming control (sub-shape A, occasionally running through to an agent-log payoff).
- Product_Intro (from `search-query-walkthrough`): when the product is introduced through its search affordance — a short `[query]` types with a blinking caret, autocomplete / results populate LIVE, and a confirm click settles the result state (sub-shape C, search skin).
- Key_Feature (from `prompt-type-submit-generate`): when the capability is demoed as ONE prompt→response round trip — submit into thinking/status states, then a streaming answer, action-log rows with brand icons, green diff cards, a chart drawing itself, or an instant generated-app reveal (sub-shapes A/B/C — the family's widest role).
- CTA (from `install-command-end-card`): the install-command end card — the closing `[headline]` DEMOTES (shrinks, grays, lifts) to make room for a `[terminal pill]` that springs in and stretches wide, the `[install command]` types out with a blinking cursor, flanking metadata and a `[tool-icon row]` pop in, and the finished card holds long. No submit, no response — the typed command IS the ask (sub-shape A, terminal skin).

**duration**: 5.2–12s (A prompt-as-hook 5.2–12s, incl. the ~7.4s CTA end card; B full generate loop 5.45–11.9s; C instant-result surface 5.7–11.9s — a long-form family: most members run 7–12s because the response needs room to arrive)

**shot structure** (a `[product input]` on/inside a `[product surface — app window, web page, terminal, browser chrome, sidebar]` over `[bg color]`; the input is the gravitational center — the camera makes at most one or two purposeful moves toward or away from it and is otherwise LOCKED; typing is character-by-character behind a visible caret, and response content arrives progressively, never dumped; three folded sub-shapes — **(A) prompt-as-hook**: the clip ends at / just after the submit (or mid-word), the ask is the show; **(B) full generate loop**: submit → status theater → the output builds block by block; **(C) instant-result surface**: the machine answers with a finished surface, often re-queried before the cut)

- **Scene 0 (optional, 0.0–~2s) — lead-in beat.** ONE establishing move before the input owns the shot: a `[headline]` types on centered and clears; a `[title card]` hard-cuts away; a brand beat (`[logo/mascot]` centered, `[serif title]` building in word groups, logo shrinking-and-rising to dock top-center); an `[orb / mark]` forms with a glowing rim; the `[app window]` flies in with motion blur and settles; or a full-frame `[thumbnail grid]` parts at its vertical centerline to clear the stage. Keep it ≤2s — the input is the star.
  - _Variant — Hook_: typed headline beats carry the intro — "[Introducing X]" types on, holds, is replaced by the `[tagline]` typing in the identical style; the typing register is established before the product ever appears.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: the capability claim types as a bare title ("[Run a task across multiple models.]") then hard-cuts to the surface — or skip Scene 0 entirely and open on the live surface mid-workflow.
  - _Variant — CTA_: the `[closing line]` types on in two steps ("[Designed.] [Not generated.]") and holds — it will demote in Scene 2.

- **Scene 1 (~1–3s) — the input takes focus.** The `[product input]` arrives or is primed: a `[pill bar]` EXPANDS sideways from the mark/chip; a `[prompt palette / card]` SPRINGS in at center with a soft shadow; ONE smooth eased/accelerating push-in crops tight onto the composer inside the `[app window]` (headline chrome slides out of frame); a `[⌘K search modal]` springs to center while the page blurs behind it; a cursor clicks a `[menu row / Assistant button]` and the prompt block appears; or a `[✕ clear button]` empties the previous query back to `[placeholder]`. Optional composer ritual (pick 1–2, before or during typing): an `[attachment]` drags in and settles in a tray below the input; a `[model / option dropdown]` opens beneath the selector, rows hover-highlight, a checkmark lands and the toolbar label updates.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: the ritual is the introduction — a `[chip grid]` fades in and the cursor arcs across 2–3 hover highlights before clicking the one that opens the composer; the affordances are the tour.
  - _Variant — Key_Feature_: the surface already carries an old `[query]` and its previous `[result panel]` — clearing it says "this is a working tool, not a mockup".

- **Scene 2 (~2–6s) — the prompt types (the engine).** The `[prompt text]` types rapidly character-by-character behind a blinking caret; the input card GROWS downward / wraps as text fills, pushing footer controls and attachments down; a typed `[token]` may convert into an inline `[brand pill]` mid-typing (`[@browser]` → a colored `[Browser]` chip, typing continues around it); the camera may run ONE slow continuous push-in toward the input, decelerating to a near-hold on the typed ask. Sub-shape (A) may END here — cut mid-word with the caret blinking, or held on the finished prompt.
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the typed ask is the cliffhanger — end on the completed prompt, or on the submit click as the interface DIMS at the cut.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (A)_: the camera dives toward the bottom input while `[option pills]` cascade in above it; the prompt is still mid-word at the cut — the product is introduced as something you talk to.
  - _Variant — CTA (A, install end card)_: the Scene-0 headline DEMOTES — scales ~50%, desaturates to gray, lifts upward — as a small `[$ chip]` spring-pops below and STRETCHES horizontally into a wide `[terminal pill]`; the `[install command]` types out inside it; a faint `[repo link]` and a "[Works with]" label fade in quietly; a row of `[tool icons]` pops in one after another with soft spring scale; the finished composition holds long, only the caret blinking.

- **Scene 3 (~4–7s) — submit + machine theater.** The `[submit control]` is clicked (cursor glide + press dip; the button may have MORPHED state on first keystroke — waveform → up-arrow — and may flip to a `[stop]` control while streaming) or the retype implies enter. The surface answers instantly with a working state: prior content VANISHES (chip grid gone, panel collapses to its slim header, whole layout swaps); then the theater — `[status phrases]` cross-dissolve with a left-to-right shimmer sweep ("[Thinking]" → "[Modeling…]" → "[Planning…]"), a `[spinner]` rotates over a loading strip, a row of `[loading cards]` lines up, or a `[checklist]` populates and its items flip one by one to green checks with strikethrough while a `[status heading]` flips tense ("[Using X]" → "[Used X]").
  - _Variant — (A) status-flare exit_: end the clip ON the theater — "[Generating…]" / the rotating spinner — the flare is the button; the answer is left to the imagination.

- **Scene 4 (rest) — the answer arrives.** Choose by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape B (full generate loop)**: the output BUILDS progressively, each block pushing content down — `[answer text]` streams paragraph by paragraph; `[action-log rows]` pop in sequentially, each with a `[brand icon]`; `[diff cards]` expand with green-highlight added lines; `[chart lines]` draw staggered left-to-right from a shared origin; an `[ASCII / summary table]` draws in; live counters tick; the surface auto-scrolls vertically to follow the newest line (page, terminal, or in-card scroll) — often under ONE slow continuous push-in on the result window.
  - **Sub-shape C (instant-result surface)**: the machine answers with a finished surface — the matching `[result / article]` renders in place; `[autocomplete chips]` stagger-pop below the bar WHILE the query types (the machine answers every keystroke), then a hover fills the `[Search button]` solid and a click confirms; the `[generated page]` rises as a rounded card and SCROLLS continuously beneath the pinned prompt; a blur-whip resolves onto the `[artifact window]` and a tab click FLIPS code → preview; or a zoom-out reveals the prompt pill was inside a full `[workspace]` where the `[content]` rewrites itself live.

- **Scene 5 (final beat) — resolve.** Diverges by role and sub-shape:
  - _Variant — Key_Feature (hold)_: HOLD on the completed output — chart finished, diff cards + `[action buttons]` fully rendered; no fade-out, no blank end frame.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (confirm)_: the cursor lands the confirming click (`[Create PR]` / `[Generate]` / `[Search]`) as the clip ends, or extras fade and a final push-in leaves the clean end state; one member hard-cuts to a minimal `[end card]` — the submit button alone at dead center with a settle pop.
  - _Variant — Hook (restart — the signature)_: a SECOND `[prompt / command]` starts typing at a fresh prompt line, or the query BACKSPACES-AND-RETYPES and the output swaps wholesale to `[result 2]` — the clip ends MID-ACTION, mid-scroll or mid-word: the loop is endless, and that is the point.
  - _Variant — CTA_: the end card from Scene 2 simply holds to the last frame; the blinking cursor is the only motion.

**motion vocabulary**: character-by-character typing with blinking caret / block cursor; typed-headline beats replacing each other; input pill grows / wraps downward into a multi-line box; prompt palette / card springs in; pill bar expands sideways from a mark or chip; orb formation with glowing rim; typed token → inline brand-pill morph mid-typing; placeholder clear; ✕-click query clear; backspace-and-retype query swap; attachment drag-in and tray settle; dropdown open + row hover-highlight + checkmark select + toolbar label update; chip-grid hover dance; cursor glide / arc with hover highlight fills; click press dip; submit-button state morph (waveform→up-arrow, submit→stop); hover fill-state swap on a Search button; content vanish / panel collapse / layout swap on submit; status-phrase cross-dissolves with left-to-right shimmer sweep; pulsing "Thinking"; spinner rotation; loading strip; animated trailing dots; loading model-card row; status-heading tense flip (Using→Used); checklist squares flipping to green checks with strikethrough; action-log rows popping in sequentially with brand icons; streaming text blocks pushing content down; green-highlight diff cards expanding; staggered left-to-right chart line-draws; ASCII / summary table draw-in; count-up ticker; vertical output scroll (page / terminal / in-card) following the newest line; generated page rising as a rounded card and scrolling beneath a pinned prompt; autocomplete chips rapid stagger-pop; code↔preview instant flip on tab click; blur-whip transition; prompt jumps to a heading on submit; zoom-out reveal from prompt pill to full UI window; single eased / accelerating push-in landing on the input; slow continuous push-in on the result window; window fly-in with motion blur; zoom + pan cropping browser chrome; ⌘K modal spring-in with background blur; full-frame grid parting at the vertical centerline; headline demotion (scale-down + desaturate + lift); chip horizontal-stretch into a wide terminal pill; quiet low-contrast metadata fade-ins; sequential spring pop-ins of an icon row; second prompt typing at the cut; interface dim / fade at the cut; long static end hold with blinking cursor.

**rule mapping**

- character-by-character typing, placeholder clear, backspace-and-retype, second prompt at the cut, typed-headline beats → `discrete-text-sequence` (typing / typos / holds / backspace) backed by `gsap-effects` (typewriter recipe)
- blinking caret / block cursor (persisting through holds) → `context-sensitive-cursor`
- prompt / status / output phrase windows, script-driven beat durations → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- input card grows downward / wraps as text fills → `anchored-layout-expand` (top-anchored downward growth, stepped at wrap boundaries)
- typed token → inline brand-pill morph mid-typing → composition: `scale-swap-transition` (token→chip swap at the conversion threshold) + `card-morph-anchor` (the reflow around the chip)
- prompt palette / modal / dropdown springs in; loading cards, log rows, diff cards, autocomplete chips, icon rows arriving staggered → `spring-pop-entrance` (single hero or staggered group)
- pill bar expands sideways from a mark; chip stretches into a wide terminal pill → `card-morph-anchor` (container morph)
- cursor glide to a control, press, ripple → `cursor-click-ripple`; the press dip + recovery → `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for cursor+button compressed together)
- hover highlight fills, Search-button instant solid fill, UI keyword accents → `asr-keyword-glow` (static-timeline glow variant) or `press-release-spring` (color-transition variation)
- attachment drag-in with cursor → `context-sensitive-cursor` (pointer↔grab) + `spring-pop-entrance` (tray settle)
- content vanish / layout swap / panel collapse on submit; code↔preview instant flip → `scale-swap-transition` (paired same-center swap) or a hard `tl.set` state swap via `discrete-text-sequence` semantics
- prompt jumps to a heading on submit → FLIP reposition — see `hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP); the travel itself via `nudge-curve` (slow-fast-slow group slide)
- status-phrase cross-dissolves with shimmer sweep → `discrete-text-sequence` (phrase swaps) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (Shimmer sweep variation — single-pass traveling sheen, clipped to the text)
- spinner rotation, animated trailing dots, pulsing loader glyphs → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating / pulsing internal SVG elements); the bounded "Thinking" pulse → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats — this pulse PERFORMS status, it is not idle wobble)
- checklist state flips, status-heading tense flip, status-pill swaps → `discrete-text-sequence` (discrete state stepping); the checkmark stamp → `svg-path-draw` or `spring-pop-entrance`
- streaming text blocks / log rows pushing content down → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (per-block windows) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-row arrival)
- vertical output scroll following the newest line (page / terminal / in-card) → composition: content translateY keyed to the same timeline as the content windows + a matched `viewport-change` counter-pan when the frame itself travels
- generated page as a rounded card whose internal content scrolls → `3d-page-scroll` (flat variant — internal scroll of a page card)
- staggered chart line-draws → `svg-path-draw` (stroke-dashoffset, staggered starts)
- count-up ticker / live counters → `counting-dynamic-scale`; result bars / fills → `stat-bars-and-fills`
- single eased push-in landing on the input; slow continuous push-in on the result → `multi-phase-camera` (push phase) with the destination framed via `coordinate-target-zoom`
- zoom-out reveal from prompt pill to full workspace; zoom + pan cropping chrome → `viewport-change` (composite pan+scale on the `.world` wrapper)
- window fly-in with motion blur; blur-whip transition → `motion-blur-streak`
- ⌘K modal with background blur → `depth-of-field-blur` (blur the page plane, keep the modal sharp) + `spring-pop-entrance`
- full-frame grid parting at the vertical centerline → `center-outward-expansion` (halves glide outward in lockstep)
- orb formation with glowing rim → `ambient-glow-bloom` + `spring-pop-entrance`
- headline demotion (scale-down + desaturate + lift) → `gsap-effects` (plain composite tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- interface dim at the cut, hard cut to a minimal end card, end mid-word / mid-scroll → exit conventions, no rule needed
- long static end hold with only the caret blinking → `context-sensitive-cursor` (the blink is the sanctioned residual motion)

**camera modifier** (the camera always serves the ask or the answer; many members are fully camera-static — typing, submit theater, and streaming carry the shot)

- ONE smooth eased / accelerating push-in that lands tight on the input and LOCKS (Hook, Product_Intro) → `multi-phase-camera` (push) + `coordinate-target-zoom` (target the input) — the defining move of the "watch me ask" opener.
- ONE slow continuous push-in running under the typing or under the output build, decelerating to a near-hold (Product_Intro, Key_Feature) → `multi-phase-camera` — gives the response weight without stealing from it.
- ONE zoom-out reveal — the prompt pill turns out to live inside a full workspace (Key_Feature, sub-shape C) → `viewport-change` (pull-back) — the inverse move; the ask was closer to the product than you thought.
- Entry-only flourishes: window fly-in with motion blur (`motion-blur-streak`), zoom + pan cropping browser chrome (`viewport-change`) — both settle before typing starts.
- Never more than two real viewport moves per shot; the frame is LOCKED during submit theater and streaming (the content scrolls, the camera does not).

## Selected motion rule: anchored-layout-expand

---
name: anchored-layout-expand
description: Edge-pinned container grows (or collapses) along ONE axis and in-flow content reflows with it — a pill springs open downward into a dropdown, a panel grows a sub-task stack, an input card stretches as typed text wraps, a pane expands over a neighbor. Transform-only (mask + slide, or proxy-driven scaleY + counter-scale) because width/height tweens are forbidden; the push on subsequent content is a matched translate on the same tween.

  tags: expand, collapse, anchored, dropdown, menu, accordion, panel, reflow, push, mask, counter-scale, layout

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>
      <div class="expand-sheet" id="expand-sheet">
        <div class="expand-row">{rowA}</div>
        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.
