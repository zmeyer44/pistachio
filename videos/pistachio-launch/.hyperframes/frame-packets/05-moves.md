keyMessage: the everyday moves are built in too.

Adapt: keep fixed-anchor-cycle's signature (a fixed anchor holds while one slot cycles through values); the anchor is the left text column + the right window frame; the cycling slots are the numeral (in-place token cycle, `vertical-spring-ticker` roll 02→03→04→05, smooth, no bounce), the title/sub, and the screenshot.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.0s): White/paper canvas. Centered two-line headline rises per-word: "And the everyday moves," / "built in around it." (display ~88px, ink; "built in" green).
Scene 2 (2.0–4.0s): The headline slides up & out as the layout arrives (`scale-swap-transition`): right ~58% a large rounded panel (radius 24px) of the wallpaper with a window frame inside it (radius 14px, traffic lights strip) showing feature-glance.jpg; left column: huge light numeral "02" (Inter 300-400, ~200px, ink), title "Glance at a link" (~56px), sub "Peek, then pick up where you were." (~30px, muted).
Scene 3 (4.0–6.0s): Numeral rolls to "03"; title/sub swap (outgoing up-and-out, incoming up-and-in, blur-to-sharp); screenshot swaps to feature-split.jpg with a short horizontal push inside the window.
Scene 4 (6.0–8.0s): "04" · "Read without the clutter" · "Just the words, on your type." · feature-reader.jpg.
Scene 5 (8.0–10.0s): "05" · "Media follows you" · "Keeps playing from the sidebar." · feature-media-stack.jpg. Hold to the cut.

## Selected blueprint: fixed-anchor-cycle

# fixed-anchor-cycle — Fixed Anchor, Cycling World

**intent**: One element is PINNED — a wordmark, a composer box, an anchor line that enters once and never moves again — while the adjacent region (or the entire surrounding theme) cycles through many discrete states around it, cadence often manipulated (steady stepping, a fast carousel, or a slow→accelerating flurry), resolving on an emphasis beat into a completed lockup or a muted freeze. The stillness of the anchor IS the claim: everything changes, this stays. Distinct from `kinetic-type-beats` sub-shape A, where a word-slot inside a centered line swaps and the sentence itself is the subject — there the anchor is a sentence frame on a bare type field; here the anchor is the PRODUCT identity and what cycles around it can be non-text (whole theme skins, chrome/logo swaps, textured label chips, a carousel list), the cycle asserts breadth ("everyone says / works everywhere / calling all X"), and the resolve completes the anchor into a lockup. Distinct from `ticker-takeover`, whose cycle ends in a collision — a hero crashes in and shoves the text aside; here nothing ever collides with the anchor: the cycle stops, and a final element quietly joins it.

**roles served**

- Brand_Outro (from `static-anchor-rapid-text-swaps`): when the sign-off is the brand name sitting immovable while praise quotes / tagline words cycle beside or beneath it — steady per-word highlight stepping, or a hard-cut chip flurry that accelerates — landing on the finished lockup ("bolt.new / prompt, run, edit, deploy / enjoy."; "Opus 4.6 by ANTHROP\C").
- Benefits: when "works everywhere" is shown literally — one product surface (a prompt composer with one verbatim string) pinned dead-center while its ENTIRE shell morphs in place through N product themes (background, typography, radii, chrome, logos all crossfading at once), ending in a washed-out freeze.
- Hook: when the opener is a roll-call — a static anchor line holds while an accent-colored line beneath it runs as a fast vertical carousel through an audience/option list, then the block clears into follow-up statement beats that land the brand line.

**duration**: 6.6–11.1s (Benefits shortest ~6.6s at 4 theme beats; Brand_Outro ~9–9.4s; Hook longest ~11s when the anchor-cycle block hands off to follow-up statement beats). The cycle engine itself occupies ~3–5s regardless of role.

**shot structure** (flat static frame — camera locked in every member; a `[bg]` field, solid or subtly drifting; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) adjacent-region cycle**: the anchor holds and a neighboring slot swaps through N states; **(B) whole-context morph**: the anchor holds and everything AROUND it re-skins in place)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.0s) — the anchor lands and PINS.** The `[anchor: wordmark / product name / composer box / lead line]` enters once — fade/scale-in centered, word-by-word build, or already present at frame one — at a fixed position it will hold for the entire clip. Zero movement from here on: no drift, no breathe, no re-layout. If the anchor is a UI surface (sub-shape B), it carries a `[verbatim string]` with a blinking cursor.

- **Scene 2 (~2.0s–~70% of runtime) — the cycle engine (signature move).** The world changes around the unmoved anchor. Choose by sub-shape:
  - **Sub-shape A (adjacent-region cycle)**: a region beside/beneath the anchor steps through N discrete states — pick ONE swap mechanic and ONE cadence:
    - _swap mechanics_: instant hard-cut label replacement (a `[chip / tape label]` slaps over the old one, texture/highlight shifting slightly, chip width re-fitting each `[phrase]` — growing away from the anchor, never over it); sequential per-word highlight stepping (one word of the `[tagline]` snaps bright/bold while the rest sits dim grey, the highlight walking the line); or a fast vertical carousel (each `[list item]` slide/fades through the accent slot ~0.5s/phrase).
    - _cadences_: steady stepping (~0.5–1s/state), or **slow→accelerating flurry** — ~1s beats compressing to ~0.15–0.3s per swap, breadth escalating into a blur of states (12–16 states read as "everyone"; 3–8 read as a roll-call).
    - Geometry law: the cycling region NEVER overlaps, touches, or displaces the anchor; size the layout so the longest state still fits inside the frame with clear margins.
  - **Sub-shape B (whole-context morph)**: at ~1.3s intervals the entire theme — `[bg color]`, typography, corner radii, toolbar icons, footer `[brand logos]`, contextual lines — morphs in place via quick (~0.3s) crossfades through N `[product skins]`, every property blending simultaneously. No hard cuts, no wipes; the anchor's content string is identical in every skin (chrome details like a `> ` prefix may adapt per skin).

- **Scene 3 (~70–85%) — the emphasis beat.** The cycle resolves — it does not just stop:
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (highlight stepping)_: the whole `[tagline]` snaps solid bright at once — full-line illumination after the per-word walk.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro (flurry)_: the flurry halts and HOLDS on the `[longest / weightiest phrase]` — a beat of stillness after acceleration.
  - _Variant — Benefits (theme morph)_: the final beat mutes — a faint `[dot-grid]` fades in across the background while the UI drops to low opacity, a washed-out blueprint freeze.
  - _Variant — Hook (carousel)_: the anchor block clears, handing off to 1–3 centered word-by-word statement beats (kinetic-type-beats territory) that carry toward the close.

- **Scene 4 (final beat → end) — lockup completion and HOLD.** A final element joins the still-unmoved anchor and the finished composition holds static to the end: a `[closing word]` drops in below, aligned to the last cycled state ("enjoy."); the chip vanishes on a hard cut and the `[brand sign-off]` appears beside the anchor on a shared baseline ("by ANTHROP\C"); or the final `[brand line]` builds word-by-word dead-center and holds ("with Copilot."). Long static hold — the lockup is the payoff, give it 20–30% of the runtime.

**motion vocabulary**: anchor fade/scale-in entrance; permanently pinned anchor (zero movement, no idle breathe); instant hard-cut label/chip replacement (slap-over with subtle texture/highlight shift); chip width resize-to-fit per phrase (grows away from the anchor); sequential per-word highlight stepping through a line; dim-to-grey line state; whole-line illumination snap; fast vertical carousel slide/fade of one line under a static line; cadence acceleration (slow ~1s beats into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry); hold-on-longest-phrase emphasis beat; in-place theme morph crossfade (~0.3s) blending background/fonts/radii/icons simultaneously; per-beat chrome/logo swap; blinking text cursor; contextual line appearing/disappearing across beats; dot-grid backdrop fade-in; global opacity washout; end freeze; word-by-word phrase build; block clear between scenes; drop-in entrance of a final word; hard cut to final lockup; long static hold.

**rule mapping**

- instant hard-cut chip/label/phrase swaps at time thresholds; per-word highlight stepping (color/weight state swaps); dim-line → full-line illumination snap; per-state chip width set (a per-state layout property, set discretely — never tweened) → `discrete-text-sequence`
- fast vertical carousel of the accent line under the static anchor (slide/fade stepped swaps in a masked slot) → `vertical-spring-ticker` (its footer-reveal step unused — Scene 4's lockup takes its place)
- per-phrase state windows computed from a script of N states (praise quotes, audience list, theme beats) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (Accelerating cadence — for the flurry, pre-compute the beat array with shrinking `hold` values, geometric decay over the state list)
- word-by-word phrase builds (anchor line, follow-up statements, final brand line) → `dynamic-content-sequencing` + `waterfall-entry` (or `kinetic-beat-slam` when the statements should land percussively)
- anchor entrance fade/scale-in; drop-in of the final closing word → `spring-pop-entrance` (restrained overshoot — the register here is editorial, not bouncy)
- blinking cursor in the pinned composer → `context-sensitive-cursor` (color adapts per theme skin at segment boundaries)
- whole-context theme morph → `theme-crossfade-morph` (N pre-styled full-scene layers stacked at the same geometry, opacity-crossfaded, the shared anchor string rendered once on top); the composer shell's radius/surface component alone → `card-morph-anchor`
- subtly drifting background field beneath the cycle → `sine-wave-loop` (bounded drift; the anchor itself gets none)
- dot-grid fade-in + global opacity washout freeze; long static hold → `gsap-effects` (plain opacity tweens) / static hold (no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: none — every member is fully camera-static; the cycle is the only motion, and the pinned anchor's stillness is load-bearing. Do not add a push-in "for energy"; it would break the anchor contract.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

| BRAND_REVEAL_AT  | < TRIGGER                             | context (brand, eyebrow) sets the stage early; revealed AT the swap it competes with the headline beat |

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

## Selected motion rule: vertical-spring-ticker

description: Slot-machine style vertical scrolling using additive spring physics within a masked container — each spring contributes one "step" of scroll.
metadata:
  tags: text, ticker, spring, scroll, vertical, slot-machine, sequence

# Vertical Spring Ticker (Slot Machine)

Multiple spring tweens are ADDED TOGETHER to produce total Y translation — each spring contributes one discrete "step", so instead of a single linear scroll you get the slot-machine "click click click" rhythm with natural settling. Distinct from a continuous marquee: this rule's semantics are discrete steps that land; for endless linear motion see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md).

## How It Works

A masked window of fixed height `ITEM_HEIGHT` (`overflow: hidden`) holds a vertical stack of items, each exactly `ITEM_HEIGHT` tall. Each spring holds a 0→1 progress; a shared `onUpdate` sums them and applies `translateY(-sum × ITEM_HEIGHT)`. Springs fire sequentially with overlap (`STEP_SPACING ≤ STEP_DUR`), so each step snaps in while the previous is still settling — that overlap is what makes them additive, and the `back.out` overshoot is what makes each step read as a "click".

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="ticker" id="ticker">
  <div class="stack-inner" id="stack-inner">
    <div class="item">{item0}</div>
    <div class="item">{item1}</div>
    <div class="item">{itemN}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.ticker {
  width: TICKER_WIDTH;
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST match .item height exactly */
  overflow: hidden; /* the mask is the window */
}
.stack-inner {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* mandatory — vertical stacking */
}
.item {
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST equal .ticker height */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  /* font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; — for numeric tickers */
}
```

```js
const innerEl = document.getElementById("stack-inner");
const springs = Array.from({ length: STEPS }, () => ({ p: 0 }));

function applyTransform() {
  const sumP = springs.reduce((acc, s) => acc + s.p, 0);
  innerEl.style.transform = `translateY(${-sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`;
}
applyTransform(); // initial state

springs.forEach((spring, i) => {
  tl.to(
    spring,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: STEP_DUR,
      ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
      onUpdate: applyTransform,
    },
    STEP_START + i * STEP_SPACING,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Numeric ticker (price / counter rolling)** — items are the digit sequence; run the same spring-step pattern per decimal position. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` required.
- **Reverse direction (countdown)** — flip the sign (`translateY(${sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`) and arrange items in reverse order.
- **Pause between groups** — several fast steps (small `STEP_SPACING`), a long pause, then one dramatic final step with a bigger `BOUNCE_FACTOR`. The pause is where the eye locks in.
- **Continuous infinite ticker** — NOT this rule (this rule is discrete steps); a looping news ticker is a single linear tween with duplicated items — see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for continuous-motion semantics.

| STEP_SPACING  | 0.3–0.5s              | **≤ STEP_DUR** so springs overlap (additive); wider gaps read as a lazy linear scroll |
| BOUNCE_FACTOR | 1.4–2.5               | 1.4 gentle click / 2.0 firm / 2.5+ casino spin-and-land for a climax step             |

Reference: `../examples/proof-logo-chain.html` (204px, 1 step, 0.45s).

## Critical Constraints

- **Container height = item height, pixel-exact, all items equal** — mismatches show partial item edges above/below the mask and accumulate drift across steps.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the container, not the inner stack**; `flex-direction: column` on the stack.
- **Sum the springs in `onUpdate` — never tween the final position directly.** Each spring contributing its OWN snap is the slot-machine pacing.
- **Overlap steps and keep `back.out` per step** — non-overlapping steps or an out-only ease collapse into a linear scroll.
- **Never update items via `innerHTML` between steps** — the ticker moves the SAME items via translate; swapping content shows the previous item AS the new one (broken illusion).
- **Climax dwell ≥1s after the final step** (SKILL universal constraint).
- **`tabular-nums` for numeric tickers** — variable digit widths break alignment.
